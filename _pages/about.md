As of fall 2023, I am a PhD student in the department of [Mathematics](https://en.math.uoa.gr/), University of Athens in Greece, under the supervision of professor [Aristides Kontogeorgis](http://users.uoa.gr/~kontogar/). My research interests lie in Arithmetic Geometry, Arithmetic Topology and Galois Representations.

For the period of April 2024 - August 2025 I work as a member of the research team [Arithmetic Geometry Group](http://users.uoa.gr/~kontogar/AGgroup/index.html) for the project "Group Actions on Algebraic Curves" funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation [(HFRI)](https://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/#).
